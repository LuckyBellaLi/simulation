All code in this folder is for PCRM, which are written in python.

The a1000d10.txt is the loading factors data ("a_k" in PCRM) needed for replicating the PCRM experiments. Simply keeping this data in the same folder as all the code in this folder, then people can directly run each of the code in python complier. Since there are random numbers generated in the code, each run of the code may get a slightly different result.
